Hi! My name is Rahul. I currently live in Oakland, California. I grew in up in San Jose and went to UC Berkeley. I have lived in the Bay Area my entire life!

Currently, I'm taking a break from work. I used to work at Affirm, as an EM and a tech lead, and Okta, as a TL and SWE, before that.

This blog / site is currently a work in progress. I'm figuring it out as I go. If you want to reach me, you can hit me up using the social links below or at rahulkartgupta@gmail.com

I recently went on a trip to India to visit my family and spent some time in Delhi. It had been six years since my last trip, so a lot of things had changed.
Moreover, my perspectives had changed, as I have become an urbanist in the past 6 years. Looking at Delhi through the lens of a pedestrian / biker / transit rider / car hater gave me a newfound appreciation for San Francisco and the Bay Area. The following or some of my thoughts from the trip.

## Do Not Walk
We are so lucky to have sidewalks, crosswalks, stop lights, and everything else that prevents cars from running over pedestrians. Delhi has none of that. Most roads don't have sidewalks, and only those that are in the neighborhood of the prime minister are not covered by shops or cars.
This is a particularly annoying issue because there is an incredible and new metro system that almost always requires you to take a car to.

## Speed Bumps Are Critical
It's fascinating to see drivers not respect any rules of the road, whether it's lanes or stop lights. It is very much an every man for himself situation. You don't need to look both directions before making a turn. You just assert yourself and slowly merge with the traffic. I was in a car where the driver rear ended someone and then sped off claiming that it was the other driver's fault.
The only thing that worked in Delhi were speed bumps. It was the only way to enforce certain driver behavior. And those speed bumps were intense. They weren't the nice round ones that we see in the staets. They are big and jut out of the road, so you can feel it.

## Governance
As I asked my family in bewilderment why all these things are happening, it became clear that the way the city, state, and federal governments all share responsibility in Delhi was a big reason for the issues at hand. For one, the police force was run by the federal government.
As a result, if the city government wanted to introduce a sidewalk, the federal governement would have to enforce the sidewalk was used for pedestrians.

## Cheap Labor means Lack of Automation
This is probably obvious to many, but I didn't fully appreciate how much the cost of labor affects the desire to automate until I went to India. I saw people carry carts of fruit on bikes and laborers carry cement on their heads.
I was amazed at how much manual labor there was, and it made me think about how the continuous rise in labor costs will drive the continuous desire to automate and get rid of labor.

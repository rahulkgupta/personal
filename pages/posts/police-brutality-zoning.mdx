Wanted to share [this]((https://twitter.com/WarrenMobility/status/1269854144883339265)) and attempt to expand on it:

It's something that I continue to struggle to articulate properly.

While police is certainly the most immediate and critical issue when it comes to BLM, defunding the police will not help with black folks gaining wealth and the desegregation of our communities, which is why housing policy and zoning is critical. "Community Character" has been abused to segregate neighborhoods, making a black man a "threat" in a white neighborhood.

I think this issue is particularly unique because it requires more "personal sacrifice" than defunding the police. It's important to acknowledge that exclusionary zoning benefits the privileged (by race and economic status) because we can afford and define the type of housing we want (backyard, nice neighborhood, etc.) Not saying that having a backyard or wanting a backyard is bad (I would love one right now), but understanding that requiring certain types of homes and community @ characteristics (like single family only zoning in the sleepy Ocean Beach of SF or the beautiful hills of Berkeley) by definition segregates.

Wealth gaining is critical as well. Until we fundamentally change how we approaching housing (which I support and will continue to find ways to make housing a right), we must remember that housing is a source of wealth, and black folks lack that wealth and are finding it harder to gain access to this source of wealth ([https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/11/buying-bay-area-home-even-more-difficult-for-black-families/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/11/buying-bay-area-home-even-more-difficult-for-black-families/)). What this means in practice is supporting for profit construction and finding ways of reducing the cost of construction / land (which is done through zoning and land policy). While fully affordable housing is incredibly important and something we should leverage to the fullest extent, we have to build housing that less wealthy and black families can invest in, which cannot be done solely through public land or affordable housing.

We have to remember that the police are not the only racist institution in town.  Land policy and city planning has excluded blacks for decades and prevented them from building that middle class level of wealth. There is a systemic reason (land policy and zoning) why neighborhoods have predominately one race and are either overpoliced or have its residents quick to call the police on outsiders. Defunding the police will stop the brutality on black folks, but it won't stop the predominately white residents from feeling like those people don't belong...

Defund BART PD.

I want to open by stating that I am the biggest BART fanboy ever. I love taking the BART as much as I can, I tell my friends to take it over Uber / Lyft, and I own the socks.

That being said, it is incomprehensible why we would be spending so much money on policing when BART is suffering through a major budget deficit. At the moment, BART PD is projected to cost over 10% of the BART budget after recently arresting someone for eating a sandwich, fining black and brown folks for not paying for train fares, and killing Oscar Grant over ten years ago.

It is unconscionable to spend so much money on a police department at this time. Taxpayer money cannot be used to promote racism, especially when BART is experiencing an existential crisis. Use this money to immediately balance your books. Use it to reduce long term expenses like police salaries and pensions. Use it to continue the great work you have been doing in continuously improving transit within the Bay Area.

Finally, I want to emphasize that this decision will impact more than just the Bay Area and BART's budget. BART is a leader among transit agencies in the nation, and defunding your police department will be a lit beacon for the rest of the nation's transit agencies to follow suit. 

You will be reducing racism, injustice, and inequality across the nation with a simple budget change. Think about that.

I hope you make the right decision.

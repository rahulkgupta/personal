Hello!

My name is Rahul. I am a Bay Area native who works in tech and loves cities and urbanism.
This blog is a work in progress. I'm hoping I can use it to share my thoughts and personal projects.
This isn't my first time trying a personal blog, and it probably won't be my last, but I'm hopeful that something will come out of this space.
Stay tuned!
